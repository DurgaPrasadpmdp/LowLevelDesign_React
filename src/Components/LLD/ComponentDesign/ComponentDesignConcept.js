        We need to follow a secure , reusable , mainatianable robust component
        design try to create a abstract component if we need to reuse speration
        of componets as small as possible easy to test --- easy to mainatain
        ---- easy to debug ----easy to change funcationalities many more //
        based on learning will fill the concept
